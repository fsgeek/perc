Intel(R) Memory Latency Checker - v3.5
Command line parameters: --bandwidth_matrix -t2 -R 

Using buffer size of 100.000MB/thread for reads and an additional 100.000MB/thread for writes
Measuring Memory Bandwidths between nodes within system 
Bandwidths are in MB/sec (1 MB/sec = 1,000,000 Bytes/sec)
Using all the threads from each core if Hyper-threading is enabled
