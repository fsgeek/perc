\chapter{Lay Summary}

For the past 40 years, memory in computers has been primarily \textit{volatile}, which 
means that the contents of the memory are lost when power is removed.  In the past
decade, memory that is \textit{non-volatile} has emerged as high density, low cost
alternative to traditional disk drives.  Recent technology improvements have made it
almost as fast as \textit{volatile} memory.  Its two key advantages are that it uses
less power, which extends battery life in small devices and reduces power requirements
in data centers, as well as providing ten times more memory in the same amount of
space.

This report explores one such technolgy and seeks to find insights into how this new
type of memory can be effectively exploited.
