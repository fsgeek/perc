\section{Observations}

\section{Future Work}

The work that I have done here has raised more questions and potential new avenues to explore than provided answers.  Some of these I expect to continue exploring and I describe them here.  Some are more speculative ideas that may warrant further exploration.  I include both of these to demonstrate some of the fruits of this research project as well as provide a semi-coherent reminder of these thoughts for future consideration.
