\end{figure}


Modern computer architecture --- the \textit{von Neumann} model --- has
evolved to systems that are fundamentally structured  as shown in Figure \ref{figure:computer_architecture},
where the processor and memory are tightly linked to one another, while
data storage is loosely coupled.  This architecture reflects that \emph{storage}
has been much slower than \emph{memory} since the introduction of core memory in
the 1950s.

This was not always the case: \emph{drum memory}, which predated core memory,
was both main memory and storage.  The introduction of core memory created
this bifurcation, as core memory was faster but more expensive.  Over time, core
memory was itself replaced with \acs{DRAM}~\cite{US3728695A}.  Storage technologies
moved from paper (punch cards and paper tape, for example) to magnetic media 
(tapes and disks).

Each of these divergent fields has undergone tremendous changes that did not remain
in lock step with one another: performance and density have increased for both
domains.  In recent years the two domains have begin to converge once again, with
storage moving to block-oriented non-volatile memories, such as flash 
memory.~\cite{bez2003introduction}

Memory technologies have continued to improve both in terms of performance --- \acs{DRAM}
was itself eclipsed by \acs{SRAM}~\cite{US4322675A} though though because \acs{SRAM} 
remains considerably more expensive than \acs{DRAM}, it is typically only used in performance
critical areas of modern computer systems (e.g., the central processing unit itself).

In \citeyear{moore1965cramming} Gordon Moore observed that the number of components that
could economically be added to an integrated circuit was increasing rapidly, an observation
that has come to be known as ``Moore's Law''.~\cite{moore1965cramming}  While most often quoted
in reference to processor technologies, the trend that Moore observed can also be observed
in memory technologies, particularly as density has led to increased memory capacities.

While magnetic storage technologies benefited from some aspects of the improvements in
integrated circuits, a fundamental characteristic of media was a significant delay in obtaining
the data --- the \textit{latency} inherent in the physical movement of the equipment imposed
a fundamental distinction that kept memory and storage separate in how they were handled by
software using the system.

    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/jeff-dean-numbers.png}
\end{figure}
    
Around ten years ago, Jeff Dean, a well-known distributed systems expert at Google gave a
presentation about the challenges of working with distributed systems.~\cite{jeff-dean:cs-295}
One of the slides in that presentation provided a succinct summary of the amount of time
to perform common operations within a computer system.  Figure \ref{figure:jeff-dean-numbers}
provides a graphic representation of the relative difference between these operations.~\cite{jboner:jeff-dean-numbers}
For the purposes of this work, the important point is to note that the speed of accessing
main memory at the time was approximately 100 nanoseconds. Reading 1MB of data from a disk
required \textbf{20 milliseconds}, half of which was the latency of the physical disk drive hardware.

        {figures/seek-times-100763046-large.jpg}%
    }%
\end{figure}


Since that time, storage has undergone a tremendous shift due to the rapid development
and deployment of solid-state storage: \textit{persistent memory} that has been used to
construct devices which mimic the behavior of disk drives. In the span of roughly 10 years,
the bandwidth of non-volatile memory devices has increased dramatically, which led to the
introduction of higher-bandwidth interconnects between the storage device and the \acs{CPU}.
Currently, the highest speed interconnect \acs{NVMe} over \acs{PCIe} has a maximum theoretical
bandwidth of approximately 32GB/s.

Many of these changes have been driven by the increased density and decreased latency for
persistent memories. The convergence of this process increasingly appears to be a model
in which the boundary between \textit{memory} and \textit{storage} overlaps.  While
pragmatic engineering realities (ergo \textit{cost}) make it likely that slower but cheaper
storage options will continue to coexist with these new technologies, non-volatile memory
technologies will be utilized in performance critical areas to improve overall system performance.

Thus, in recent years we have seen \acs{DRAM}-like non-volatile memory solutions appear.  Frequently,
they have combined DRAM, non-volatile (flash) memory, and some backup power source ---
typically a large battery --- into providing large capacity, high performance, byte-addressable,
non-volatile memory, such as shown in Figure \ref{figure:scm}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \caption{Battery-Backed Hybrid DRAM/Flash Memory}\label{figure:scm}
    \emph{Source: RTC Magazine, http://archive.rtcmagazine.com/articles/view/102366}
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/102366-2700_RTC11-PRTW-Viking-Fig1_medium.jpg}
\end{figure}

This type of ``storage class memory'' is not widely used, given its disadvantages, which include
cost, the need for external batteries, the lack of standardized support, and the relatively low
density offered --- often on par with \acs{DRAM}.

At the end of May, 2018 --- \textit{after} the commencement of working on this project, in fact,
Intel announced availability of their first \textit{byte-addressable} non-volatile memory modules,
with a form factor that makes them compatible with industry standard \acs{DDR4} 
memory.~\cite{anandtech:apache_pass}  While Intel has not confirmed the technology behind this
new memory, there has been considerable independent analysis indicating that the underlying
technology is \acs{PCM}.~\cite{malventano:2017:3DXPoint}

The ``hands-on'' analysis provided in this report is based upon Intel ``Apache Pass'' \acs{NVDIMM}
form-factor memory.  While interesting to have actual hardware to use in the evaluation, I have
tried to focus on insights that are not tied to the specific product.  This seems prudent because
Intel and Micron recently announced they would be terminating their joint development program 
next year.~\cite{Intel:3DXPoint:JDP:July:2018}

Commercialization of non-volatile memory technologies for the production of DIMM form factor
persistent memory devices is an active area.  These technologies include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \acs{PCM} --- This is the basis of the Intel/Micron developed 3D XPoint memory and
    forms the basis of the Intel Apache Pass product (which will use the Optane\textsuperscript{tm} trade name
    when released.)
    \item \acs{MRAM} --- STT-MRAM is being used in high capacity enterprise SSD devices from IBM, and is
    available in a DIMM form factor, but does not yet appear to have achieved high densities though it
    does show high performance.~\cite{MRAM-info}
    \item \acs{FRAM} --- Ferroelectric Random Access Memory is commercially utilized non-volatile memory
    technology that has continues to be an area of active research in improving scalability.~\cite{mikolajick2018ferroelectric}
    \item \acs{ReRAM} --- Resistive Random Access Memory, the technology based upon the \textit{memristor}, continues
    to be yet another area of ongoing research.\cite{zhu2017resistive,lastras2018resistive}
    \item \acs{NRAM} --- Non-volatile Random Access Memory utilizes Carbon Nanotubes for data storage.  These memories
    are presently in production and in use in specialized environments due to the novel thermal characteristics of Carbon
    nanotubes.~\cite{gilmer2018nram}
\end{itemize}

Several of these are already used in specialized environment.  For the most promising, the challenge remains
commercializing the technology, often through scaling density or achieving economically viable cost/benefit levels.

In fact, it seems likely that several of these technologies will be used in the future for providing memory.  While
there is some value in evaluating the behavior of specific memory technology, it is somewhat ephemeral given the
ever-changing nature of the technology industry.

It is more useful to find insights, even from such focused study, that provide a general sense of understanding
about persistent memory.  To that end, I have considered a number of aspects of the behavior of non-volatile
memory:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Failure Models} --- For any persistent data structure, it is imperative to understand the failure
    model of the domain. The challenge in this area is that storage experts are used to thinking of I/O related
    failure models, while processor behavior experts are used to considering consistency and correctness, but not
    persistence.

    \item \textbf{Performance} --- storage systems are traditionally high-latency.  There are write amplification
    issues that must be carefully evaluated.  Memory systems have concerns about cache behavior, the cost of
    consistency, and issues of memory locality because \acs{NUMA} architectures create unequal costs for accessing
    specific memory.

    \item \textbf{Consistency} --- persistence amplifies the cost of inconsistent state.  A traditional way to 
    recover from inconsistent machine state is to restart, which returns to a known-good state.  When memory
    is persistent, inconsistent states do not automatically resolve when the system restarts.

\end{itemize}

I discuss failure models in Chapter \ref{ch:Model} and insights gleaned from the
work with \acs{NVM} in Chapter \ref{ch:Discussion}.

This document provides a quick set of instructions for using the
\class{ubcdiss} class to write a dissertation in \LaTeX. 
Unfortunately this document cannot provide an introduction to using
\LaTeX.  The classic reference for learning \LaTeX\ is
\citeauthor{lamport-1994-ladps}'s
book~\cite{lamport-1994-ladps}.  There are also many freely-available
tutorials online;
\webref{http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/}{Andy Roberts' online
    \LaTeX\ tutorials}
seems to be excellent.
The source code for this docment, however, is intended to serve as
an example for creating a \LaTeX\ version of your dissertation.

We start by discussing organizational issues, such as splitting
your dissertation into multiple files, in
\autoref{sec:SuggestedThesisOrganization}.
We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\ in
\autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
We cover managing and using bibliographies with \BibTeX\ in
\autoref{sec:BibTeX}. 
We briefly describe typesetting attractive tables in
\autoref{sec:TypesettingTables}.
We briefly describe including external figures in
\autoref{sec:Graphics}, and using special characters and symbols
in \autoref{sec:SpecialSymbols}.
As it is often useful to track different versions of your dissertation,
we discuss revision control further in
\autoref{sec:DissertationRevisionControl}. 
We conclude with pointers to additional sources of information in
\autoref{sec:Conclusions}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Suggested Thesis Organization}
\label{sec:SuggestedThesisOrganization}

The \acs{UBC} \acf{GPS} specifies a particular arrangement of the
components forming a thesis.\footnote{See
    \url{http://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/dissertation-thesis-preparation/order-components}}
This template reflects that arrangement.

In terms of writing your thesis, the recommended best practice for
organizing large documents in \LaTeX\ is to place each chapter in
a separate file.  These chapters are then included from the main
file through the use of \verb+\include{file}+.  A thesis might
be described as six files such as \file{intro.tex},
\file{relwork.tex}, \file{model.tex}, \file{eval.tex},
\file{discuss.tex}, and \file{concl.tex}.

We also encourage you to use macros for separating how something
will be typeset (\eg bold, or italics) from the meaning of that
something. 
For example, if you look at \file{intro.tex}, you will see repeated
uses of a macro \verb+\file{}+ to indicate file names.
The \verb+\file{}+ macro is defined in the file \file{macros.tex}.
The consistent use of \verb+\file{}+ throughout the text not only
indicates that the argument to the macro represents a file (providing
meaning or semantics), but also allows easily changing how
file names are typeset simply by changing the definition of the
\verb+\file{}+ macro.
\file{macros.tex} contains other useful macros for properly typesetting
things like the proper uses of the latinate \emph{exempli grati\={a}}
and \emph{id est} (\ie \verb+\eg+ and \verb+\ie+), 
web references with a footnoted \acs{URL} (\verb+\webref{url}{text}+),
as well as definitions specific to this documentation
(\verb+\latexpackage{}+).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Making Cross-References}
\label{sec:CrossReferences}

\LaTeX\ make managing cross-references easy, and the \latexpackage{hyperref}
package's\ \verb+\autoref{}+ command\footnote{%
    The \latexpackage{hyperref} package is included by default in this
    template.}
makes it easier still. 

A thing to be cross-referenced, such as a section, figure, or equation,
is \emph{labelled} using a unique, user-provided identifier, defined
using the \verb+\label{}+ command.  
The thing is referenced elsewhere using the \verb+\autoref{}+ command.
For example, this section was defined using:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \section{Making Cross-References}
    \label{sec:CrossReferences}
\end{lstlisting}
References to this section are made as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
    We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\
    in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
\end{lstlisting}
\verb+\autoref{}+ takes care of determining the \emph{type} of the 
thing being referenced, so the example above is rendered as
\begin{quote}
    We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\
    in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
\end{quote}

The label is any simple sequence of characters, numbers, digits,
and some punctuation marks such as ``:'' and ``--''; there should
be no spaces.  Try to use a consistent key format: this simplifies
remembering how to make references.  This document uses a prefix
to indicate the type of the thing being referenced, such as \texttt{sec}
for sections, \texttt{fig} for figures, \texttt{tbl} for tables,
and \texttt{eqn} for equations.

For details on defining the text used to describe the type
of \emph{thing}, search \file{diss.tex} and the \latexpackage{hyperref}
documentation for \texttt{autorefname}.

\section{Managing Bibliographies with \BibTeX}
\label{sec:BibTeX}

One of the primary benefits of using \LaTeX\ is its companion program,
\BibTeX, for managing bibliographies and citations.  Managing
bibliographies has three parts: (i) describing references,
(ii)~citing references, and (iii)~formatting cited references.

\subsection{Describing References}

\BibTeX\ defines a standard format for recording details about a
reference.  These references are recorded in a file with a
\file{.bib} extension.  \BibTeX\ supports a broad range of
references, such as books, articles, items in a conference proceedings,
chapters, technical reports, manuals, dissertations, and unpublished
manuscripts. 
A reference may include attributes such as the authors,
the title, the page numbers, the \ac{DOI}, or a \ac{URL}.  A reference
can also be augmented with personal attributes, such as a rating,
notes, or keywords.

Each reference must be described by a unique \emph{key}.\footnote{%
    Note that the citation keys are different from the reference
    identifiers as described in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.}
A key is a simple sequence of characters, numbers, digits, and some
punctuation marks such as ``:'' and ``--''; there should be no spaces. 
A consistent key format simiplifies remembering how to make references. 
For example:
\begin{quote}
   \fbox{\emph{last-name}}\texttt{-}\fbox{\emph{year}}\texttt{-}\fbox{\emph{contracted-title}}
\end{quote}
where \emph{last-name} represents the last name for the first author,
and \emph{contracted-title} is some meaningful contraction of the
title.  Then \citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop}'s seminal article on
aspect-oriented programming~\cite{kiczales-1997-aop} (published in
\citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop}) might be given the key
\texttt{kiczales-1997-aop}.

An example of a \BibTeX\ \file{.bib} file is included as
\file{biblio.bib}.  A description of the format a \file{.bib}
file is beyond the scope of this document.  We instead encourage
you to use one of the several reference managers that support the
\BibTeX\ format such as
\webref{http://jabref.sourceforge.net}{JabRef} (multiple platforms) or
\webref{http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net}{BibDesk} (MacOS\,X only). 
These front ends are similar to reference manages such as
EndNote or RefWorks.


\subsection{Citing References}

Having described some references, we then need to cite them.  We
do this using a form of the \verb+\cite+ command.  For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \citet{kiczales-1997-aop} present examples of crosscutting 
    from programs written in several languages.
\end{lstlisting}
When processed, the \verb+\citet+ will cause the paper's authors
and a standardized reference to the paper to be inserted in the
document, and will also include a formatted citation for the paper
in the bibliography.  For example:
\begin{quote}
    \citet{kiczales-1997-aop} present examples of crosscutting 
    from programs written in several languages.
\end{quote}
There are several forms of the \verb+\cite+ command (provided
by the \latexpackage{natbib} package), as demonstrated in
\autoref{tbl:natbib:cite}.
Note that the form of the citation (numeric or author-year) depends
on the bibliography style (described in the next section).
The \verb+\citet+ variant is used when the author names form
an object in the sentence, whereas the \verb+\citep+ variant
is used for parenthetic references, more like an end-note.
Use \verb+\nocite+ to include a citation in the bibliography
but without an actual reference.
\nocite{rowling-1997-hpps}
\begin{table}
\caption{Available \texttt{cite} variants; the exact citation style
    depends on whether the bibliography style is numeric or author-year.}
\label{tbl:natbib:cite}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lp{3.25in}}\toprule
Variant & Result \\
\midrule
% We cheat here to simulate the cite/citep/citet for APA-like styles
\verb+\cite+ & Parenthetical citation (\eg ``\cite{kiczales-1997-aop}''
    or ``(\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop} \citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop})'') \\
\verb+\citet+ & Textual citation: includes author (\eg
    ``\citet{kiczales-1997-aop}'' or
    or ``\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop} (\citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop})'') \\
\verb+\citet*+ & Textual citation with unabbreviated author list \\
\verb+\citealt+ & Like \verb+\citet+ but without parentheses \\
\verb+\citep+ & Parenthetical citation (\eg ``\cite{kiczales-1997-aop}''
    or ``(\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop} \citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop})'') \\
\verb+\citep*+ & Parenthetical citation with unabbreviated author list \\
\verb+\citealp+ & Like \verb+\citep+ but without parentheses \\
\verb+\citeauthor+ & Author only (\eg ``\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop}'') \\
\verb+\citeauthor*+ & Unabbreviated authors list 
    (\eg ``\citeauthor*{kiczales-1997-aop}'') \\
\verb+\citeyear+ & Year of citation (\eg ``\citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop}'') \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Formatting Cited References}

\BibTeX\ separates the citing of a reference from how the cited
reference is formatted for a bibliography, specified with the
\verb+\bibliographystyle+ command. 
There are many varieties, such as \texttt{plainnat}, \texttt{abbrvnat},
\texttt{unsrtnat}, and \texttt{vancouver}.
This document was formatted with \texttt{abbrvnat}.
Look through your \TeX\ distribution for \file{.bst} files. 
Note that use of some \file{.bst} files do not emit all the information
necessary to properly use \verb+\citet{}+, \verb+\citep{}+,
\verb+\citeyear{}+, and \verb+\citeauthor{}+.

There are also packages available to place citations on a per-chapter
basis (\latexpackage{bibunits}), as footnotes (\latexpackage{footbib}),
and inline (\latexpackage{bibentry}).
Those who wish to exert maximum control over their bibliography
style should see the amazing \latexpackage{custom-bib} package.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Typesetting Tables}
\label{sec:TypesettingTables}

\citet{lamport-1994-ladps} made one grievous mistake
in \LaTeX: his suggested manner for typesetting tables produces
typographic abominations.  These suggestions have unfortunately
been replicated in most \LaTeX\ tutorials.  These
abominations are easily avoided simply by ignoring his examples
illustrating the use of horizontal and vertical rules (specifically
the use of \verb+\hline+ and \verb+|+) and using the
\latexpackage{booktabs} package instead.

The \latexpackage{booktabs} package helps produce tables in the form
used by most professionally-edited journals through the use of
three new types of dividing lines, or \emph{rules}.
% There are times that you don't want to use \autoref{}
Tables~\ref{tbl:natbib:cite} and~\ref{tbl:LaTeX:Symbols} are two
examples of tables typeset with the \latexpackage{booktabs} package.
The \latexpackage{booktabs} package provides three new commands
for producing rules:
\verb+\toprule+ for the rule to appear at the top of the table,
\verb+\midrule+ for the middle rule following the table header,
and \verb+\bottomrule+ for the bottom-most at the end of the table.
These rules differ by their weight (thickness) and the spacing before
and after.
A table is typeset in the following manner:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \begin{table}
    \caption{The caption for the table}
    \label{tbl:label}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \toprule
    Header & Elements \\
    \midrule
    Row 1 & Row 1 \\
    Row 2 & Row 2 \\
    % ... and on and on ...
    Row N & Row N \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
\end{lstlisting}
See the \latexpackage{booktabs} documentation for advice in dealing with
special cases, such as subheading rules, introducing extra space
for divisions, and interior rules.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Figures, Graphics, and Special Characters}
\label{sec:Graphics}

Most \LaTeX\ beginners find figures to be one of the more challenging
topics.  In \LaTeX, a figure is a \emph{floating element}, to be
placed where it best fits.
The user is not expected to concern him/herself with the placement
of the figure.  The figure should instead be labelled, and where
the figure is used, the text should use \verb+\autoref+ to reference
the figure's label.
\autoref{fig:latex-affirmation} is an example of a figure.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    % For the sake of this example, we'll just use text
    %\includegraphics[width=3in]{file}
    \Huge{\textsf{\LaTeX\ Rocks!}}
    \caption{Proof of \LaTeX's amazing abilities}
    \label{fig:latex-affirmation}   % label should change
\end{figure}
A figure is generally included as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{file}
    \caption{A useful caption}
    \label{fig:fig-label}   % label should change
    \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
There are three items of note:
\begin{enumerate}
\item External files are included using the \verb+\includegraphics+
    command.  This command is defined by the \latexpackage{graphicx} package
    and can often natively import graphics from a variety of formats.
    The set of formats supported depends on your \TeX\ command processor.
    Both \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{xelatex}, for example, can
    import \textsc{gif}, \textsc{jpg}, and \textsc{pdf}.  The plain
    version of \texttt{latex} only supports \textsc{eps} files.

\item The \verb+\caption+ provides a caption to the figure. 
    This caption is normally listed in the List of Figures; you
    can provide an alternative caption for the LoF by providing
    an optional argument to the \verb+\caption+ like so:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    \caption[nice shortened caption for LoF]{%
	longer detailed caption used for the figure}
    \end{lstlisting}
    \ac{GPS} generally prefers shortened single-line captions
    in the LoF: multiple-line captions are a bit unwieldy.

\item The \verb+\label+ command provides for associating a unique, user-defined,
    and descriptive identifier to the figure.  The figure can be
    can be referenced elsewhere in the text with this identifier
    as described in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
\end{enumerate}
See Keith Reckdahl’s excellent guide for more details,
\webref{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex.pdf}{\emph{Using
imported graphics in LaTeX2e}}.

\section{Special Characters and Symbols}
\label{sec:SpecialSymbols}

\LaTeX\ appropriates many common symbols for its own purposes,
with some used for commands (\ie \verb+\{}&%+) and
mathematics (\ie \verb+$^_+), and others are automagically transformed
into typographically-preferred forms (\ie \verb+-`'+) or to
completely different forms (\ie \verb+<>+).
\autoref{tbl:LaTeX:Symbols} presents a list of common symbols and
their corresponding \LaTeX\ commands.  A much more comprehensive list 
of symbols and accented characters is available at:
\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/}
\begin{table}
\caption{Useful \LaTeX\ symbols}\label{tbl:LaTeX:Symbols}

\LaTeX & Result && \LaTeX & Result \\
\midrule

    \verb+\textcopyright+ & \textcopyright && \verb+\{ \}+ & \{ \} \\
    \verb+\textregistered+ & \textregistered && \verb+\%+ & \% \\

    \verb+\textless+ & \textless && \verb+\_+ & \_ \\
    \verb+\textgreater+ & \textgreater && \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Changing Page Widths and Heights}

The \class{ubcdiss} class is based on the standard \LaTeX\ \class{book}
class~\cite{lamport-1994-ladps} that selects a line-width to carry
approximately 66~characters per line.  This character density is
claimed to have a pleasing appearance and also supports more rapid
reading~\cite{bringhurst-2002-teots}.  I would recommend that you
not change the line-widths!

\subsection{The \texttt{geometry} Package}

Some students are unfortunately saddled with misguided supervisors
or committee members whom believe that documents should have the
narrowest margins possible.  The \latexpackage{geometry} package is
helpful in such cases.  Using this package is as simple as:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \usepackage[margin=1.25in,top=1.25in,bottom=1.25in]{geometry}
\end{lstlisting}
You should check the package's documentation for more complex uses.

\subsection{Changing Page Layout Values By Hand}

There are some miserable students with requirements for page layouts
that vary throughout the document.  Unfortunately the
\latexpackage{geometry} can only be specified once, in the document's
preamble.  Such miserable students must set \LaTeX's layout parameters
by hand:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \setlength{\topmargin}{-.75in}
    \setlength{\headsep}{0.25in}
    \setlength{\headheight}{15pt}
    \setlength{\textheight}{9in}
    \setlength{\footskip}{0.25in}
    \setlength{\footheight}{15pt}

    % The *sidemargin values are relative to 1in; so the following
    % results in a 0.75 inch margin
    \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-0.25in}
    \setlength{\evensidemargin}{-0.25in}
    \setlength{\textwidth}{7in}       % 1.1in margins (8.5-2*0.75)
\end{lstlisting}
These settings necessarily require assuming a particular page height
and width; in the above, the setting for \verb+\textwidth+ assumes
a \textsc{US} Letter with an 8.5'' width.
The \latexpackage{geometry} package simply uses the page height and
other specified values to derive the other layout values.
The
\href{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/layout.pdf}{\texttt{layout}}
package provides a
handy \verb+\layout+ command to show the current page layout
parameters. 


\subsection{Making Temporary Changes to Page Layout}

There are occasions where it becomes necessary to make temporary
changes to the page width, such as to accomodate a larger formula. 
The \latexmiscpackage{chngpage} package provides an \env{adjustwidth}
environment that does just this.  For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
    % Expand left and right margins by 0.75in
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-0.75in}{-0.75in}
    % Must adjust the perceived column width for LaTeX to get with it.
    \addtolength{\columnwidth}{1.5in}
    \[ an extra long math formula \]
    \end{adjustwidth}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Keeping Track of Versions with Revision Control}
\label{sec:DissertationRevisionControl}

Software engineers have used \acf{RCS} to track changes to their
software systems for decades.  These systems record the changes to
the source code along with context as to why the change was required.
These systems also support examining and reverting to particular
revisions from their system's past.

An \ac{RCS} can be used to keep track of changes to things other
than source code, such as your dissertation.  For example, it can
be useful to know exactly which revision of your dissertation was
sent to a particular committee member.  Or to recover an accidentally
deleted file, or a badly modified image.  With a revision control
system, you can tag or annotate the revision of your dissertation
that was sent to your committee, or when you incorporated changes
from your supervisor.

Unfortunately current revision control packages are not yet targetted
to non-developers.  But the Subversion project's
\webref{http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/}{TortoiseSVN}
has greatly simplified using the Subversion revision control system
for Windows users.  You should consult your local geek.

A simpler alternative strategy is to create a GoogleMail account
and periodically mail yourself zipped copies of your dissertation.

\section{Recommended Packages}

The real strength to \LaTeX\ is found in the myriad of free add-on
packages available for handling special formatting requirements.
In this section we list some helpful packages.

\subsection{Typesetting}

\begin{description}
\item[\latexpackage{enumitem}:]
    Supports pausing and resuming enumerate environments.

\item[\latexpackage{ulem}:]
    Provides two new commands for striking out and crossing out text
    (\verb+\sout{text}+ and \verb+\xout{text}+ respectively)
    The package should likely
    be used as follows:
    \begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage[normalem,normalbf]{ulem}
    \end{verbatim}
    to prevent the package from redefining the emphasis and bold fonts.

\item[\latexpackage{chngpage}:]
    Support changing the page widths on demand.

\item[\latexpackage{mhchem}:] 
    Support for typesetting chemical formulae and reaction equations.

\end{description}

Although not a package, the
\webref{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/}{\texttt{latexdiff}}
command is very useful for creating changebar'd versions of your
dissertation.


\subsection{Figures, Tables, and Document Extracts}

\begin{description}
\item[\latexpackage{pdfpages}:]
    Insert pages from other PDF files.  Allows referencing the extracted
    pages in the list of figures, adding labels to reference the page
    from elsewhere, and add borders to the pages.

\item[\latexpackage{subfig}:]
    Provides for including subfigures within a figure, and includes
    being able to separately reference the subfigures.  This is a
    replacement for the older \texttt{subfigure} environment.

\item[\latexpackage{rotating}:]
    Provides two environments, sidewaystable and sidewaysfigure,
    for typesetting tables and figures in landscape mode.  

\item[\latexpackage{longtable}:]
    Support for long tables that span multiple pages.

\item[\latexpackage{tabularx}:]
    Provides an enhanced tabular environment with auto-sizing columns.

\item[\latexpackage{ragged2e}:]
    Provides several new commands for setting ragged text (\eg forms
    of centered or flushed text) that can be used in tabular
    environments and that support hyphenation.

\end{description}


\subsection{Bibliography Related Packages}

\begin{description}
\item[\latexpackage{bibunits}:]
    Support having per-chapter bibliographies.

\item[\latexpackage{footbib}:]
    Cause cited works to be rendered using footnotes.

\item[\latexpackage{bibentry}:] 
    Support placing the details of a cited work in-line.

\item[\latexpackage{custom-bib}:]
    Generate a custom style for your bibliography.

\end{description}
